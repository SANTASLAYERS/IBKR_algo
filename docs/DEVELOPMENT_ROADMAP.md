# Multi-Ticker IB Trading Framework - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

This framework automates research, order routing, and risk controls for many US-equity tickers. It connects to Interactive Brokers Gateway to fetch market data, executes trades based on predictions, and manages positions with robust risk controls.

## System Components Roadmap

### 1. Market Data Aggregation System
- Implement a way to get agregated data over a certain range.

### 2. Position Management System
- Implement portfolio tracking across multiple symbols
- Create position objects with risk metrics (P&L, exposure, etc.)
- Build position lifecycle management (open, modify, close)
- Add account-level risk controls and exposure management
- Implement reporting and visualization of positions

### 3. Event-Driven Order Management
- Design an event system for order state transitions
- Implement event handlers for order events (fill, partial fill, rejection)
- Create a workflow engine for complex order strategies
- Build bracket/OCO order management for stop losses and take profits
- Add scale-in/scale-out logic with conditional triggers
- Implement order cancellation and modification handling

### 4. Technical Indicator Framework
- Build a modular system to calculate indicators like ATR on the 1-minute bars
- Implement a base indicator class that can be extended for various indicators
- Include real-time updates as new price data arrives
- Add caching and efficient recalculation for indicator values
- Implement indicator-based alerts and conditions

### 5. Prediction API Integration
- Develop the API client interface to fetch trade predictions
- Implement structured response handling and error management
- Create a polling/notification system to get predictions at appropriate intervals
- Add correlation between predictions and actual market conditions
- Implement prediction quality metrics and tracking

### 6. Strategy Execution Engine
- Build a rule-based engine to convert predictions to executable orders
- Implement time-based execution windows and constraints
- Add market condition filters (volatility, liquidity)
- Create backtesting capabilities for strategy validation
- Implement strategy performance metrics

### 7. Risk Management Layer
- Build portfolio-level risk controls and exposure limits
- Implement circuit breakers for unusual market conditions
- Add correlation-aware position sizing and risk calculations
- Create drawdown management and recovery mechanisms
- Implement compliance and regulatory safeguards

### 8. Monitoring and Reporting
- Develop a real-time monitoring dashboard
- Implement performance tracking and analytics
- Create automated reporting for trading sessions
- Add alerting for system health and trading anomalies
- Build visualization tools for market data and positions

## Implementation Sequence

The implementation will proceed in the order listed above, as each component builds upon the previous ones. The first priority is the Market Data Aggregation System as it forms the foundation for indicators, predictions, and trading decisions.

## Technical Considerations

- Async-first architecture using Python's asyncio
- Strong typing and validation throughout the system
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Thorough testing, including unit and integration tests
- Performance optimization for multi-ticker operation
- Clean separation of concerns between components
- Configuration-driven behavior for flexibility
