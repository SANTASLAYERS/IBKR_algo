| 1 | API Integration | âœ… Complete | âœ… Passed | Prediction signal processing implemented with placeholders for future data sources |
| 2 | Position Management | âœ… Complete | âœ… Passed | Position lifecycle, tracking, and risk management implemented |
| 3 | Order Management | âœ… Complete | âœ… Passed | Order creation, tracking, and lifecycle management implemented |
| 4 | Rule Engine | â¬œ Pending | â¬œ Not Tested | Not yet implemented |
| 5 | Integration and Testing | ðŸ”„ In Progress | â¬œ Not Tested | Basic integration between components demonstrated |

## Completed Components

### Event System Components

- **BaseEvent**: Foundation class for all events (Tested: âœ…)
- **EventBus**: Central message dispatcher with pub/sub pattern (Tested: âœ…)
- **Event Types**:
  - MarketEvent: Price, volume, and indicator events (Tested: âœ…)
  - OrderEvent: Order lifecycle events (Tested: âœ…)
  - PositionEvent: Position lifecycle events (Tested: âœ…)
  - OptionsFlowEvent: API prediction signals (Tested: âœ…)

### API Integration Components

- **OptionsFlowMonitor**: Monitors and processes prediction signals (Tested: âœ…)
- Placeholder implementations for:
  - Trade data processing (Pending future implementation)
  - Divergence data processing (Pending future implementation)

### Position Management Components

- **Position**: Base position class with lifecycle management (Tested: âœ…)
- **StockPosition**: Stock-specific position implementation (Tested: âœ…)
- **PositionTracker**: Manages multiple positions (Tested: âœ…)

### Order Management Components

- **Order**: Base order class with lifecycle management (Tested: âœ…)
- **OrderGroup**: Base class for managing related orders (Tested: âœ…)
- **BracketOrder**: Entry + stop loss + take profit implementation (Tested: âœ…)
- **OCOGroup**: One-cancels-other order group implementation (Tested: âœ…)
- **OrderManager**: Manages orders and integrates with broker (Tested: âœ…)

## Testing Results

### Event System Tests

- Event creation and properties: âœ… Passed
- Event bus subscription and publishing: âœ… Passed
- Inheritance-based event routing: âœ… Passed
- Event unsubscription: âœ… Passed

### Position Management Tests

- Position lifecycle (creation, updates, closing): âœ… Passed
- Position tracking across multiple positions: âœ… Passed

- Order validation and status transitions: âœ… Passed
- Order group management (brackets, OCO): âœ… Passed
- Order manager integration: âœ… Passed

### Integration Demos

#### Position Management Demo
- Integrated position management with event system: âœ… Passed
- Position creation from prediction signals: âœ… Passed
- Position updates from price events: âœ… Passed
- Position adjustments (trailing stops): âœ… Passed
- Position closing from signals: âœ… Passed

#### Order Management Demo
- Order creation and submission: âœ… Passed
- Order lifecycle management: âœ… Passed
- Bracket orders (entry + stop + target): âœ… Passed
- OCO orders (one-cancels-other): âœ… Passed
- Order cancellation: âœ… Passed

## Known Issues

1. **Event Handler Errors**: Some errors occur when handling events with missing fields (TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__)
2. **Asyncio Locking**: Initial implementation had issues with asyncio locks causing the application to hang
   - Resolved by simplifying the locking mechanism for demonstration purposes
   - In a production implementation, proper thread-safety would need to be implemented

## Next Steps

1. Implement Rule Engine
   - Rule condition and action framework
   - Rule evaluation system
   - Rule prioritization and scheduling

2. Complete Integration
   - Integrate order management with position management
   - Connect rule engine to other components
   - Create comprehensive end-to-end tests

3. IBKR Gateway Integration
   - Connect order manager to actual IBKR Gateway
   - Implement callbacks for order status and fills
   - Add robust error handling and reconnection
