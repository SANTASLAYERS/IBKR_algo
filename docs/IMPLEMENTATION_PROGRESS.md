## Current System Capabilities

The system is now **production-ready** for automated trading with the following capabilities:

1. **Automated Trading Rules**: Create sophisticated trading rules based on API predictions
2. **Real TWS Execution**: Place and manage real orders through Interactive Brokers TWS
3. **Risk Management**: Built-in position sizing, stop losses, and take profits
4. **Live Market Data**: Real-time price feeds for decision making
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responsive system that reacts to market and API events
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: 29 integration tests with real TWS connections

## Remaining Work

### For Production Deployment:

## System Architecture Status

The complete trading system architecture is implemented:

```
API Predictions → Rule Engine → Order Manager → TWS → Real Trading
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
Event System → Position Tracker → Risk Mgmt → Market Data
```
