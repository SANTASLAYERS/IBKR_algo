# TWS Order Management Test Index

## Chronological Order of Test Development

This index shows the order in which tests were developed to solve specific issues:

### Phase 1: Basic Order Submission
1. **Initial order flow test** (logs: `test_slv_buy_flow.log`)
   - Identified that stop/target/double down orders weren't submitting
   - Led to adding `auto_submit=True` fix

### Phase 2: Order ID and ATR Issues  
2. **ATR calculation tests** (logs: `test_atr_output.log`, `test_atr_new.log`)
   - Fixed timezone issues with historical data requests
   - Fixed Unix timestamp parsing
   - Fixed variable naming inconsistencies

### Phase 3: Duplicate Prevention
3. **`test_trade_tracker_duplicate_prevention.py`**
   - Created TradeTracker to prevent duplicate positions
   - Integrated with LinkedCreateOrderAction

4. **`test_multi_symbol_trades.py`**
   - Verified TradeTracker doesn't block different symbols
   - Confirmed multi-symbol trading works

### Phase 4: Context Management
5. **`test_context_order_tracking.py`**
   - Demonstrated value of context-based tracking
   - Showed manual vs automatic order management

6. **`test_order_management.py`**
   - Tested comprehensive order lifecycle
   - Verified double down fill handling

7. **`test_context_capabilities.py`**
   - Final comprehensive test of all capabilities
   - Demonstrated complete order management system

- **Order ID Management Fixed**: Proper incrementing and bulk ID requests  
- **ATR Working**: Timezone and date parsing fixes
- **Duplicate Prevention Working**: TradeTracker integration
